# This script defines an elliptic curve over a finite field with prime \( p = 2^{255} - 19 \), a specific curve used in Curve25519. The curve parameters are set, and a point \( G \) is defined on the curve by lifting \( x = 9 \). The script then multiplies the point \( G \) by a scalar \( a = 0x1337c0decafe \), and prints the x-coordinate of the resulting point. The output is the secret value associated with the given scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve.
