*hill* seems like a very important hint from the challenge description. Searched around, it led me to Hill Cipher. Used [online decoder for Hill Cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/hill-cipher)

```bash
Cipher: rtca{vbuhp_kaiq_gfj_nx_rda_ujw}
resize MxN matrix to 3x3 matrix fill with
16 25 8 
14 19 5 
15 17 3
set A = 0
```

Decrypted the cipher to get string *FLAGCLIMBYOURWAYTOTHETOP*, formatted it accordingly to get the flag *flag{climb_you_way_to_the_top}*.
