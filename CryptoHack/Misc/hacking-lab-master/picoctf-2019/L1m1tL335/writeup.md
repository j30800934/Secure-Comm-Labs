The program allows user to input integer value into specific position addressed by index. We can overwrite the function return address with address of``win``. To find out the address we needs try out some possible numbers.

So we input address of ``win`` for the first integer value, try out index in range ``[-512, 0]``.
Finally ``-5`` brought the flag.
