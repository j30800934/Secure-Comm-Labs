# 9
# This script calculates the modular inverse of `3` modulo `13` using the `pow` function in Python. The `pow(3, -1, 13)` expression computes the value of `3` raised to the power of `-1` modulo `13`, which is the modular inverse of `3` under modulo `13`. The result is `9`, as `3 * 9 â‰¡ 1 (mod 13)`.
