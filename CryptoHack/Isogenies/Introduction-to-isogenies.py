# 65537

# A separable isogeny is a type of morphism between elliptic curves in algebraic geometry. The kernel of a separable isogeny of degree \(d\) refers to the set of points on the curve that map to the identity element under the isogeny. For separable isogenies, the kernel contains exactly \(d\) elements, where \(d\) is the degree of the isogeny.

# In this case, the number `65537` might refer to a specific degree or a prime number commonly used in cryptographic applications, but without further context, itâ€™s difficult to ascertain its exact role here. It could be a reference to the degree of a separable isogeny or a specific mathematical constant related to the problem.
